    description: `Overview
Embark on a unique, community-led adventure at the Sera Rhino Sanctuary in Samburu, the first and only community-managed black rhino sanctuary in East Africa—and the only place in Northern Kenya where visitors can track both black and white rhinos on foot. Established in 2015 after a 30-year absence caused by poaching, Sera reintroduced black rhinos and, in 2024, expanded conservation efforts by introducing southern white rhinos. Guided by expert Samburu trackers and armed rangers, explore 26,000 acres of wilderness—home to the "Samburu Special Five": reticulated giraffe, Grevy's zebra, Beisa oryx, Somali ostrich, and gerenuk—and engage meaningfully with local communities safeguarding wildlife.

Highlights
• Track rhinos on foot with Samburu guides and armed rangers using traditional methods.
• Learn how community stewardship drives wildlife protection and sustainable livelihoods.
• Spot iconic species including reticulated giraffe, Grevy's zebra, Somali ostrich, Beisa oryx, and gerenuk.

Included/Excluded
• Included: A friendly, professional guide
• Excluded: Personal expenses; insurance; drinks and meals; additional services not mentioned

What to Expect
Itinerary
• Start with an informative session led by conservancy rangers outlining safety protocols, the sanctuary's history, and how your visit supports conservation.
• Head out with expert guides using traditional tracking methods to follow signs of rhinos. Once a rhino is found, you'll observe from a safe yet intimate distance—often just meters away—while learning about their behaviors and threats.
• Along the walk or during optional game drives, spot species such as Grevy's zebra, reticulated giraffe, and Beisa oryx.

Cancellation policy
• You can cancel up to 48 hours before the experience starts for a refund.

Duration
2 hours (fallback)

Language
English

Frequently Asked Questions
• Do I need prior experience? No—experienced trackers and rangers guide the entire walk.
• How does my visit help? Revenue supports rhino protection, ranger patrols, and community programs.
• Is it safe? Yes—walks are led by trained, armed rangers under strict protocols.

    description: `Overview
On Lake Baringo's eastern shores, the Ruko Giraffe Sanctuary unites the Il Chamus and Pokot communities in a powerful conservation effort. In 2020, nine stranded Rothschild's giraffes were rescued from a flooded island via a custom-built barge and relocated to the mainland sanctuary. The population has since flourished, with successful breeding and future reintroduction plans.

Highlights
• Guided sanctuary tour with insights into behavior, conservation, and history
• Potential sightings of other regional wildlife
• Community engagement and cultural learning

Included/Excluded
• Included: A friendly, professional guide
• Excluded: Personal expenses; insurance; drinks and meals; additional services not mentioned

What to Expect

• Embark on a nature walk through the sanctuary to observe Rothschild's giraffes and learn about their rescue and rewilding.
